# SCIMClient
An open-source implementation of a SCIM V2 client that is fully compatible with Entra ID. This library works with both users and groups. A Swagger front-end and a very simple demo repository class is included. It also works with the standard enterprise extensions in Entra ID. No authorization for the endpoints is included, and you need to manually add this to use th library in production.

This software is 100%free without ifs or buts under the MIT license. [If you like it, feel free to buy me a coffee.](buymeacoffee.com/Tobiesen)
